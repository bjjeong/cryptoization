# cryptoization

## Background and Overview
Cryptoization is a data visualization application created to show the all the transactions happening for Bitcoin (BTC) in real time.

Users will be able to see each transaction visualized in the form of spheres, differing in size. The size of the circle will be in direct relation to size of the transaction, measured either in BTC or in USD.

Users will also be able to hear a sound whenever a new transaction is made. The sound's tone will depend on the size of the trasaction as well.
